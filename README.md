# Welcome! 

We created a [wiki](https://github.com/Camzcamz/EXTminus23andMe/wiki) to help you evaluate (1) the quality of your summary statistics after data removal and (2) the suitability of these downsampled summary statistics for typical follow-up genetic analyses (e.g. prediction with polygenic scores). 

In the wiki, you'll find the steps, data, and code. 

As a case, we evaluate the quality and suitability of the externalzing summary statsitics without 23andMe data.
